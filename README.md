> **Want to download movies from torrent,but also want to use less data usage? Here is the solution.**

Torrent Compressor allows you to compress torrent files in video format and lets you download it. <br>
You could also compress any direct download links.
Default Compression(100MB --> 20MB)

To use this I have used Google Colab ,Where you paste the magnet link of torrent and then you will be able to compress the file and download it

Use this app to get magnet links : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.content.magnetsearch
